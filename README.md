# ConsumeSpotifyAPI

Followed this tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZJvdFDCKxM&ab_channel=TechWithPat to consume the Spotify API for the top 20 releases in Australia. 
It is an asp.net core web app (model-view-controller) using .Net 5

Note: didn't commit the appsettings.json file as contains client id and client secret. 

This is what it looks like:

Created a diagram to understand the flow better.
